This font is the artifact for my graphic design capstone project and is a working .otf font that you can download for free on here. I only ask that you attribute my name either through my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/thomaskrajna_artist) or though my [website](https://www.thomaskrajna.com/). 

This work came from the inspiration on the "hidden" world of bacteria and influences from biomimicry. Each of the 94 glyphs within the dingbat font came from the digitization of several petri dishes over the span of 3 days that were marked within the forms of the 7 typetoms which can be seen in figure 1.

The term asemic which is used to differentiate within the Vitro font has plays a huge role within my work since there are aspects of language or communication that are beyond our understanding or systems. This can be seen within the nutrient of agar communicating with the bacteria from the source of my cheek to form visual clusters. There is a sense of reflection or virtualization that happens when we find other ways of communicating that are different from our own but can be seen within our own latin based framework such as the plastic dish is to the bacteria. This process of virtualizaton is also named by another term that I used within my own art practice which is cognitive estrangement. This process of the cognitive estrangement within the asemic forms can generate new meaning and new applications which is fruitful for what (de)sign can be.

This work was also meant to create more awareness on the involvement of the invisible and our ecological foundation. This work is being commenced on 5/5/22 during the beginning of the graphic design capstone show for University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 

	POSTHUMAN (DE)SIGN AMONG 
        THE NON-HUMAN MANIFESTO
        
        Definitions
    	_Posthuman_: A critique of enlightenment humanism for a synthesis of new defining characteristics
    	_Non-human_: The things outside the bounds of the colloquial term “human”
    	_(De)sign_: Meaning creation for the referent

        PROCLAMATION OF AXIOMS
            1. (De)sign beyond the function
            2. (De)sign beyond the human
            3. Inmaterial communication is more important than material communication: Geist dance
            4. The mark can seduce essence entrapment: know how memories can be incubated
            5. Consciousness creates reality through symbolic and imaginary realms  
            6. Use the non-human as an aid
            7. Invisibility can be a designer’s curse or spell
    
Technology originates as our will and becomes transferred through the medium of the form. For example, a human that has limited eyesight could desire technology for an alternation on their base human abilities. This means that we are already posthuman in which (de)sign needs to re-envision this human-centered cognitive apparatus. To reconcile this is one goal of posthuman (de)sign. It has been since the beginning, designers have used the outside world to create shelter as in mud for an example and from that (de)sign has accelerated. The non-human such as ideals, ecologies, mud, and spectacles can all aid the designer. The rejection of agency within marks and objects has haunted the (de)sign field and for its betterment the designer shall become beyond their own subject and towards a collective consciousness of subjectivities.
