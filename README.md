# VITRO-ASEMIC
This dingbat font was created with FontForge, Photoshop, and Illustrator in response to the manifesto below. The process started by digitizing three petri dishes that were marked in the forms of the seven Henderson’s typtoms in order to cultivate consciousness that is beyond the human.

This work is being commenced on 5/5/22 during the beginning of the graphic design capstone show for University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 

POSTHUMAN (DE)SIGN AMONG THE NON-HUMAN MANIFESTO

Definitions:
Posthuman: A critique of enlightenment humanism for a synthesis of new defining characteristics
Non-human: The things outside the bounds of the colloquial term “human”
(De)sign: Meaning creation for the referent

PROCLAMATION OF AXIOMS
(De)sign beyond the function
(De)sign beyond the human
Inmaterial communication is more important than material communication: geist dance
The mark can seduce essence entrapment: know how memories can be stored in the material
Consciousness creates reality through symbolic and imaginary realms  
Use the non-human as an aid
Invisibility can be a designer’s curse or spell

Technology originates as our will and becomes transferred through the medium of the form. For example, a human that has limited eyesight desires to see will seek out technology for an alternation on their base human abilities. This means that we are already posthuman in which (de)sign needs to revitalize that cognitive apparatus. To reconcile this is one goal of posthuman (de)sign. It has been since the beginning, designers have used the outside world to create shelter as in mud for an example and from that (de)sign have (has) accelerated. The non-human such as ideals, ecologies, mud, and spectacles can all aid the designer. The rejection of agency within marks and objects has haunted the (de)sign field and for its betterment the designer shall become beyond their own subject and towards a collective consciousness of subjectivities.
